# Reflection

The hardest thing I encountered was getting the mouse to properly turn a grid space in the "on" state. I solved it and eventually got it worked with serveral grids.

If I were to redo my project, I would personnally center the grid on the screen. This would make it easier to have ui on the sides of the grid.

I completed all on my need to have except getting the beats per minute that the gridline visualized.
